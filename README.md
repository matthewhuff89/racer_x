#jQuery Battle

##Scope
You've just been hired as a game developer for Games Forever to create a web game using JavaScript. You've been given total creative control with a few tiny constraints. The game needs to be controlled using the left, up, down, and right keys (or if you prefer the WASD keys)

##Project Description
The Manager has laid out the following requirements for the project.
* This game must use jQuery.
* The user must be able to play the game using the WASD keys and the Up, Left, Down, Right keys.
* It must have at least one player.
* There must be a win condition for players.
* There must be optional objectives


##Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, the employee will be able to create interactive pages and games using key binding events with jQuery and object oriented JavaScript to manipulate a web page or create a game.

##References/Tools

* [jQuery keypress docs](https://api.jquery.com/keypress/)
* [Key Codes](www.quirksmode.org/js/keys.html)

##Instructions


##Getting Started

You are going to need at least 3 different files in your repository:
1. An HTML file
2. A CSS stylesheet
3. A JavaScript file to hold your application code and your jQuery code.

##Creating a Game Board
There's many ways to create a board to play on.
We suggest using HTML5 Canvas (and we'll link some resources that will help with that!)
You could also use HTML5 Tables to create a grid and change the cell elements based on key bindings.
* [How to Make A Simple HTML5 Canvas Game](http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/)
* [Create HTML5 Canvas JavaScript Game Character](http://www.williammalone.com/articles/create-html5-canvas-javascript-game-character/1/)

##Create A Player Character
The above resources should help, but try thinking about creating an object in javascript that will have a sprite, key bindings attached to move it, and the ability to respond to other elements in the game (like an enemy or another player)

##Game Sprites
Check out this resource, or try googling "Sprites" for images to use for your player characters
[Sprites To Use](http://www.spriters-resource.com/)


##Vocabulary
* Event Handler
* Key Bindings
* Multiplayer Game
